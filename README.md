# Omega-Dash-Casing
Case to house the Omega Dash - Designed to be wall mounted.


I designed this case so I could wall mount my Omega Dash. The case is in two parts that clip together using snaps. 

I designed this using the Dash Beta device and the LCD moved around a bit so some adjustment to the LCD recess may be required, I'll update it once I receive my production devices.
